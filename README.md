Module 14 Challenge
I created a horizontal bar chart with a dropdown menu to display the top 10 OTUs in that individual. I used saemple_values as the values for the bar chart, I used otu_labels as the labels for the bar chart, and I also used otu_labels as the hover textfor the chart. I created the bubble chart that displays each sample. I displayed the sample's metadata that is an individual's demographic information. I also updated all the plots when a new sample is selected. I deleted my app to a free static page hosting service, such as Github pages.
